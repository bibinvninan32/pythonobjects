# Step 1
# Create a class named 'Action'. 
# Within the class, create a constructor method (look it up if you're not sure).
# The constructor should take two lists as arguments (Look into positional vs named arguments). 
# Save those lists to a variable which would be accessible by every other method within the class (once we add more methods/functions).
